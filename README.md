# DX-Ball ðŸŽ®  
*A Classic Arcade Game Developed in C*

## Overview  
This project is a recreation of the popular classic game **DX-Ball**, developed as a term project for **Level-1/Term-I** under the course **CSE 102: Structured Programming Sessional**. The game is implemented using **iGraphics**, a graphics library for C, showcasing fundamental concepts of structured programming and game development.

### Key Features  
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: 
  - Break bricks using a ball and paddle.
  - Difficulty increases with game progression.
- **Graphics and Animation**: 
  - Vibrant visuals and smooth animations using the iGraphics library.
- **User Interaction**: 
  - Paddle movement controlled via keyboard input.  
  - Real-time collision detection between the ball, bricks, and paddle.
- **Levels and Scoring**:
  - Multiple levels of increasing complexity.
  - Score tracking throughout the game.
- **Custom Background Music**:
  - Play any music of your choice during the game! Add your own music files (in `.wav` format) to the **Sound** directory.

### Instructions  
1. **Preserve Directory Structure**:
   - Do not make any changes to the **"Files"** and **"Pics"** directories as they are essential for the game's functionality.
2. **Add Custom Music**:
   - Convert your music file to `.wav` format.  
   - Place the file in the **"Sound"** directory and name it using the format **`n.wav`**, where `n = 1, 2, or 3`.  
     - Files named **`1.wav`, `2.wav`, or `3.wav`** will play during gameplay.  
     - A file named **`0.wav`** will play as background music on the home screen.  

### Challenges and Learning Outcomes  
This project was a stepping stone in understanding structured programming and game logic. Key challenges included:
1. **Collision Detection**: Implementing accurate ball-brick and ball-paddle interactions.
2. **Game Loop Design**: Managing the gameâ€™s flow and ensuring smooth animation.
3. **Graphics Handling**: Using iGraphics to create engaging visuals and animations.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with structured programming, problem-solving, and graphical application development.

### Technical Details  
- **Language**: C  
- **Graphics Library**: iGraphics  
- **Development Environment**: Code::Blocks
