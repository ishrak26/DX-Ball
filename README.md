You are requested not to make any change to "Files" and "Pics" directory. 
You can play any music of your choice in the background. Convert your music file to "wav" format. Go to the "Sound" directory, add your own music and make sure your filename follows the format "n.wav", where n = 1, 2, or 3.
If your music file title is "0.wav", it will play in the home background, otherwise, during gameplay.
Feel free to contact and inform me about various bugs you find at ishrak26@gmail.com.
Enjoy!
